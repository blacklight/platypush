Description
===========

This is the main documentation hub for Platypush. It includes both the wiki and
the complete reference of the available integrations.

Platypush is a general-purpose automation framework that can be used to cover
all the cases where you'd use a home automation hub, a media center, a smart
assistant, some IFTTT recipes, and a variety of other products and services.

It draws inspiration from the following projects, and it aims to cover all of
their use-cases:

* `Home Assistant <https://www.home-assistant.io/>`_
* `Homebridge <https://homebridge.io/>`_
